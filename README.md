### 🎩 About Me

Hey! I’m a tech tinkerer with a thing for Debian, privacy tools, and all kinds of weird and wonderful tech. I’m all about building custom Docker containers 🐳, crafting pen testing tools 🔍, and diving into projects that make tech a little more interesting. Always open to collaborating, especially if it involves automation scripts or some cool ASCII art.
